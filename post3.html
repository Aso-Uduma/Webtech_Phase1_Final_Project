    <h1>The Proposal Template That Gets Me 80% Response Rates</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>A great proposal doesn’t just list your skills — it makes the client feel like you already understand their problem. Here’s the structure I use that consistently gets replies.</p>

    <h2>Section 1 – Personalized Opening</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mention their business by name.</li>
      <li>Reference something specific from their request or website.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 2 – Problem & Solution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Restate their problem in your own words.</li>
      <li>Outline your solution in 3–4 bullet points.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 3 – Why Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2–3 sentences on your relevant experience.</li>
      <li>Link to similar projects in your portfolio.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 4 – Timeline & Investment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear delivery phases (e.g., Design: 1 week, Development: 2 weeks).</li>
      <li>Price with your three‑tier method.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Section 5 – Call to Action</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Invite them to a quick call.</li>
      <li>End with a confident but friendly close: <em>“If this sounds good, I can get started as early as Monday.”</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Keep it under 2 pages. Clients skim — make every word count.</em></p>
