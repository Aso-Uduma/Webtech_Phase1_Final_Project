          <p class="testimonial-text">“Working with Aso Uduma was a game‑changer for our MVP launch. He didn’t just code — he helped us refine our feature set so we could hit the market faster. The dashboard he built is clean, fast, and scalable. My only feedback is that we should have involved him earlier in the planning stage — it would have saved us even more time.”</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">"I came to Aso Uduma with a slow, outdated online store. Within three weeks, he rebuilt it with a modern stack, integrated secure payments, and improved our page load speed by over 60%. He was proactive in suggesting upsell features I hadn’t considered. If I could change one thing, it would be to schedule more frequent check‑ins during the design phase — but the end result was worth it.”</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">“We needed a custom client portal that could handle file uploads, messaging, and analytics — all in one place. Aso Uduma delivered exactly that, on time and within budget. He also documented the code so our in‑house devs could maintain it easily. The only challenge was aligning our internal deadlines with his, but he was flexible and accommodating throughout.”</p>
